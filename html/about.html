    <br><p>People have been playing chess for more than 1500 years. Invented in India in the 6th century CE,
    <br>its earliest known form was called chaturanga. The pieces originally represented the military units
    <br>common in warfare at that time: infantry, cavalry, elephants, chariots, a general, and a king.</p>
